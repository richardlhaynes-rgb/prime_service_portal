        "solution": "Poor performance is usually caused by model \"bloat\" or unmanaged warnings.\nAudit the Model: When opening the central model, check the \"Audit\" box. This will scan the model for errors and fix them. This should be done weekly.\nPurge Unused:\nGo to the \"Manage\" tab > \"Purge Unused\".\nA dialog box will appear. Click \"Check All\".\nClick OK. This removes all unused families, view templates, and other elements that bloat the file. Run this 2-3 times in a row to remove nested items.\nReview Warnings:\nGo to the \"Manage\" tab > \"Warnings\".\nReview the warnings. A high number of warnings (especially \"Room/Area is not in a properly enclosed region\" or \"Highlighted elements overlap\") will severely slow down the model.\nFix the most critical warnings.\nDisable Add-ins: Temporarily disable all third-party add-ins to see if one of them is causing the slowdown.\nClose Inactive Views: Revit only regenerates views that are open. Close all views you are not actively working on to speed up model interactions.\nSource (for internal reference): https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-improve-optimize-or-troubleshoot-model-performance-in-Revit.html",

        "problem": "A user needs to get their PRIME email, calendar, and contacts on their iPhone or Android device.",
        "solution": "For security, do not use the native \"Mail\" app. You must use the official Microsoft Outlook app.\nGo to the App Store (iPhone) or Google Play Store (Android).\nSearch for and download \"Microsoft Outlook\".\nOpen the Outlook app.\nWhen prompted to add an account, enter your full PRIME email address (e.g., user@primeeng.com).\nClick \"Add Account\".\nYou will be redirected to the PRIME login page.\nEnter your password when prompted.\nYou will then be prompted for 2FA/MFA. Approve the login using the Duo Mobile application on your device.\nYour email and calendar will begin syncing to the app.\nIT Rationale (for internal reference): We specifically require the Microsoft Outlook app instead of native mail apps (like Apple Mail) for three main reasons:\nSecurity & Control (Main Reason):\nSelective Wipe: If a phone is lost or an employee leaves, IT can wipe only the Outlook app and its data, leaving all personal photos and files untouched. Wiping a native mail app often requires wiping the entire device.\nApp-Level PIN: We can enforce a separate PIN/Face ID just to open the Outlook app, adding a layer of security even if the phone is unlocked.\nData Protection: We can prevent users from copying sensitive company data out of Outlook and into personal apps (like a personal notepad or email).\nFeatures & Compatibility:\nThe Outlook app fully supports all Microsoft 365 features, such as shared calendars, scheduling tools, and sensitivity labels, which often break or don't work in native apps.\nCompliance:\nUsing a managed app helps us prove that company data is secured according to our policies, which is critical for client data and compliance.\nSource (for internal reference): https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/set-up-email-in-the-outlook-for-android-app-886db551-8dfa-4fd5-b835-f8e53609eFF1",

If the tab is missing, the driver is not loading.\nRe-run the Driver (The Main Fix): The easiest and most reliable fix is to re-install the 3Dconnexion add-ins.\nGo to the 3Dconnexion website and download the latest 3DxWare driver.\nClose 3ds Max. This is a critical step.\nRun the 3DxWare installer you just downloaded. It will detect your installed version of 3ds Max and re-install the plug-in for it.\nRestart your PC and open 3ds Max.
