Choose the \"Back up and Reset Custom Settings\" option. This will create a backup of your current settings in a ZIP file before resetting.\n6. Allow the reset utility to run. It will re-launch AutoCAD, which will appear as it did on a fresh installation.",

Save the drawing after the audit completes.\n\nRECOVER: If AUDIT does not fix the issue, type RECOVER. Select the corrupt drawing file. AutoCAD will attempt a deeper repair. Save the recovered file with a new name.\n\nPURGE (All): In the command line, type PURGE. In the dialog box, check all checkboxes (including 'Purge nested items'). Click 'Purge All'. Repeat this process until the 'Purge All' button is grayed out.\n\nSAVE: Save the drawing.\n\nWBLOCK (For severe corruption): If the steps above are not enough, WBLOCK (Write Block) can export the drawing data to a new, clean file. Type WBLOCK in the command line. Select the 'Entire drawing' option. Specify a new file name and location. Click OK. Open the new file you just created.

Repeat until no items remain.\n\nCompact the Central File (Worksharing Only): On the BIM 360/ACC server, locate the central model. Right-click and select 'Compact Central Model'. This removes old worksets and SWC history.\n\nAudit the File: Go to File > Open. Check the 'Audit' box before opening the file. This repairs internal errors.\n\nDisable Worksharing Display Modes: Avoid using 'Worksharing Display' modes during active work. These add visual overhead.\n\nReview Worksets: Unload heavy worksets (e.g., site models, large linked files) that are not needed for the current task.\n\nUpgrade Hardware: If the model is genuinely large (>1GB), ensure the workstation meets Revit's recommended specs (16GB+ RAM, dedicated GPU).",
